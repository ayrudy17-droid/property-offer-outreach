    <p>Hi {{owner_name}},</p>
    <p>I'm reaching out regarding {{property_address}}. Based on recent sales and expected repairs, I can offer <strong>${{offer_price}}</strong> in as-is condition with a flexible closing timeline.</p>
    <p>We can handle clean-out and basic repairs, and there are no realtor commissions.</p>
    <p>If this is of interest, reply to this email and we can talk through details.</p>
    <p>Thanks,<br/>{{from_name}}</p>
